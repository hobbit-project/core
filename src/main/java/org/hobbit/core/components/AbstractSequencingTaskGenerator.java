/**
 * Extension of the {@link AbstractTaskGenerator} that offers methods to wait
 * for acknowledgements for single tasks. The workflow for waiting for a task is
 * <ul>
 * <li>generate a task and a task id (for the latter {@link #getNextTaskId()}
 * should be used)</li>
 * <li>set the task id which will be sent next using
 * {@link #setTaskIdToWaitFor(String)}</li>
 * <li>send the task to the system with
 * {@link #sendTaskToSystemAdapter(String, byte[])} and
 * {@link #sendTaskToEvalStorage(String, long, byte[])}</li>
 * <li>wait for the acknowledgement using {@link #waitForAck()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b> that the acknowledgements only work if the evaluation storage is
 * configured to send acknowledgements for the single tasks.
 * </p>
